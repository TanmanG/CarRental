# Explaination
Greetings!

This is my on-going implementation of an car rental database system. It includes cars owned by a company, accounts created (in addition to customer information), and transactions which contain unique IDs for each car and account.

Presently it is purely back-end, however ideally I want to create a forward facing webpage that allows people to interact with it- but that's some time out.

Currently I'm working on implementing serialization using Boost.
